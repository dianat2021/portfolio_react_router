            <p>
              I'm a Senior Web Developer specializing in front-end development.
              I was born in a city called Shahroud which is located in the north
              of Iran. Since I started high school, computers, and programming
              have been an inseparable part of my life. I received my Associate
              Degree in the field of Computer Software Engineering. I learned
              about programming languages such as HTML, CSS, C#, and SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
              In continuation of my studies, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in
              Computer Software Technology Engineering. During my Bachelor's
              studies, I leaned more towards front-end engineering. I learned
              Javascript and improved my HTML and CSS knowledge and it helped me
              to design, develop, and maintain several websites. I moved to
              Oslo, Norway to study a Master's degree in Programming and System
              Architecture at University of Oslo. During my studies, i learned
              about React, Redux, privacy concepts such as GDPR, Agile
              methodologies, and design principles. I graduated in 2022 with the
              GPA of "A".
